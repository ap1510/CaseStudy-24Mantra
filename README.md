In 2018, during my second year of college, I participated in a case study competition focused on driving growth for 24 Mantra Organic, a leading organic food brand. Our team analyzed key challenges, including price sensitivity, consumer trust deficits, and brand differentiation, and proposed data-driven marketing, B2B expansion, and global positioning strategies to enhance brand loyalty and sales. Through a combination of digital campaigns, expert collaborations, and institutional partnerships, we developed a scalable and sustainable business strategy to help 24 Mantra strengthen its market presence and customer engagement.
